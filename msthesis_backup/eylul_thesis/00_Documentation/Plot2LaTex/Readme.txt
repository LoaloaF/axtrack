	Known bugs
- Plot2LaTeX does not support text color. Matlab export function to svg is not configured correctly
- Sizes of figures between svg and fig can be different if size is specified in other units than px. This has to do with how Matlab exports the fig to svg.
- Saving after manual rotation of 3d figures does not work. No idea why not. Matlab saves the labels as paths and not as true text to svg.
