1) Introduction
---------------

Matfig2PGF is a MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/> script that allows users
to convert MATLAB figures to PGF <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/>.
PGF figures can be included in a LaTeX document using the PGF macro package.
The PGF package works with most important LaTeX backends (such as pdfTeX
and Dvips). Using Matfig2PGF all text in the figure is typeset by LaTeX, so
it blends in nicely with the rest of the document.

Features:
- 2D plots
- subplots
- histograms
- linear and logarithmic axes
- grids
- legends
- line styles and plot marks
- resulting pgf file can be used in LaTeX and pdfLaTeX


---------------
2) Requirements
---------------
Matfig2PGF has been tested with the following MATLAB versions. Other versions
might or might not work, please let me know.
- MATLAB R2007b

To compile a LaTeX document with a PGF figure the following package is
required:
- PGF package <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/>

3) Upgrading
------------
If you are upgrading from version 0.2 or older you must remove it completely
before installing the new version. If you created a custom
matfig2pgf_options.m it must be removed too. User defined default options
are now read from useroptions.cfg. See useroptions.cfg.example for the
format.


--------
4) Usage
--------

In order to use Matfig2PGF the m-file matfig2pgf.m must be placed in the
MATLAB search path (see
http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_env/f10-26235.html
for more information). Now Matfig2PGF is ready to use. Type:
'help matfig2pgf' to see how to use Matfig2PGF to convert MATLAB figures to
PGF files.

Matfig2PGF can add a menu item to all figure windows. See
'help matfig2pgf_menu' for more information.

After the PGF file has been created it can be included in a LaTeX document.
A minimal example LaTeX document is listed below.

\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{pgf}
\usepackage{pgffor}
\usepgflibrary{plothandlers}

% Or, for older PGF versions (<= 1.01)
%\usepackage{pgf}
%\usepackage{pgffor}
%\usepackage{pgflibraryplothandlers}

\begin{document}
  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \input{figure.pgf}
    \caption{Figure created by Matfig2PGF}
  \end{figure}	
\end{document}

- Fixed: Color property of text objects was ignored

v0.3.7 (2008-08-09)
Many thank to Nico Schlömer for submitted these patches.
- Fixed: updated draw_patch function. Contour plots should now be handled
         better.
- Fixed: some smaller bugs.

v0.3.6 (2008-07-06)
- Fixed: tick markers where drawn when box was set 'off'.
- Fixed: lines crossing the visible axis area, but without point within the
         visible area where not printed.

v0.3.5 (2008-03-30)
- Fixed: line reduction/decimation did not work properly in certain
         situations.
- Added: support for contour plots. Many thanks to Felix Heß for submitting
         this patch.

v0.3.4 (2008-01-19)

         output.

v0.3.3 (2007-12-07)

- Fixed: some labels contain only whitespace, these are now skipped too

       Matlab function hist()).

v0.3 (2006-12-30)
- Changed: Redone options implementation. Default user options are no
           longer stored in matfig2pgf_options.m. From now on they are
           stored in useroptions.cfg.
- New: Added Matfig2pgf menu item to figure windows for easy saving.
- New: Added window to choose options more easily.

v0.2 (2006-11-26)
