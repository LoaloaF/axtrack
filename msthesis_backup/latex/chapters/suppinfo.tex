             preprocessing steps. \textbf{A} A snapshot of the exported video
             including the relevant metadata of the recording. \textbf{B} The
             napari image viewer interface with the edge segmentation layer in
             brown. \textbf{C} The manually segmented binary mask of the micro
             channels in non-black, the output channel in green, and the exiting
             channels in brown. The green dot in the output channel marks the
             target point of the PDMS design.}

    \caption[Axon growth cone labelling]{Axon growth cone labelling. \textbf{A} shows a
             snapshot of the napari image viewer during labelling. Each circle
             represents a growth cone label, the color corresponds to the
             identity. Each axon identity is saved as a napari-Points layer
             which are listed on the left. \textbf{B} illustrates the axon
             identify lifetime. A green point on this pixel map indicates that a
             label exists for the matching axon identity and frame. The
             three clusters originate from the concatenation of three
             PDMS microstructure timelapse videos. }

             \textbf{A} shows the first frame of the training data sequence.
             Each box represents a growth cone, the color indicates the identity
             over consecutive frames. \textbf{B} shows the last frame of
             Dataset1. \textbf{C} shows the last frame of Dataset2, PDMS micro
             structure 1 (compare Table \ref{datasets_table}). \textbf{D} shows
             the last frame of Dataset2, PDMS micro structure 2. Gridsize = 317
