To this end, detection quality is identified as a key factor influencing tracking performance, where changing the detector can improve tracking by up to 18.9%. Despite only using a rudimentary combination of familiar techniques such as the Kalman Filter and Hungarian algorithm for the tracking components, this approach achieves an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art online trackers. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of our tracking method, the tracker updates at a rate of 260 Hz which is over 20x faster than other state-of-the-art trackers.},

   abstract = {The use of implants that allow chronic electrical stimulation and recording in the brain of human patients is currently limited by a series of events that cause the deterioration over time of both the electrode surface and the surrounding tissue. The main reason of failure is the tissue inflammatory reaction that eventually causes neuronal loss and glial encapsulation, resulting in a progressive increase of the electrode-electrolyte impedance. Here, we describe a new method to create bio-inspired electrodes to mimic the mechanical properties and biological composition of the host tissue. This combination has a great potential to increase the implant lifetime by reducing tissue reaction and improving electrical coupling. Our method implies coating the electrode with reprogrammed neural or glial cells encapsulated within a hydrogel layer. We chose fibrin as a hydrogel and primary hippocampal neurons or astrocytes from rat brain as cellular layer We demonstrate that fibrin coating is highly biocompatible, forms uniform coatings of controllable thickness, does not alter the electrochemical properties of the microelectrode and allows good quality recordings. Moreover, it reduces the amount of host reactive astrocytes-over time-compared to a bare wire and is fully reabsorbed by the surrounding tissue within 7 days after implantation, avoiding the common problem of hydrogels swelling. Both astrocytes and neurons could be successfully grown onto the electrode surface within the fibrin hydrogel withoutaltering the electrochemical properties of the microelectrode.This bio-hybrid device has therefore a good potential to improve the electrical integration at the neuron-electrode interface and support the long-term success of neural prostheses.},

   abstract = {Neural prosthetics capable of recording or stimulating neuronal activity may restore function for patients with motor and sensory deficits resulting from injury or degenerative disease. However, overcoming inconsistent recording quality and stability in chronic applications remains a significant challenge. A likely reason for this is the reactive tissue response to the devices following implantation into the brain, which is characterized by neuronal loss and glial encapsulation. We have developed a neural stem cell-seeded probe to facilitate integration of a synthetic prosthesis with the surrounding brain tissue. We fabricated parylene devices that include an open well seeded with neural stem cells encapsulated in an alginate hydrogel scaffold. Quantitative and qualitative data describing the distribution of neuronal, glial, and progenitor cells surrounding seeded and control devices are reported over four time points spanning 3 months. Neuronal loss and glial encapsulation associated with cell-seeded probes were mitigated during the initial week of implantation and exacerbated by 6 weeks post-insertion compared to control conditions. We hypothesize that graft cells secrete neuroprotective and neurotrophic factors that effect the desired healing response early in the study, with subsequent cell death and scaffold degradation accounting for a reversal of these results later. Applications of this biohybrid technology include future long-term neural recording and sensing studies.},

@article{neuropixel,
   abstract = {New silicon probes known as Neuropixels are shown to record from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in awake and freely moving rodents. Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions. Existing technologies reliably measure activity from a relatively small number of neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, or from a large volume of neurons with low resolution. Timothy Harris and colleagues describe the design, fabrication and performance of Neuropixels, a silicon probe that can measure well-isolated neural activity from hundreds of neurons. They integrated these probes into a lightweight system that could record activity simultaneously and with high fidelity from hundreds of neurons in awake and freely moving rodents. Sensory, motor and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures1,2. Existing extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) resolution, but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging3,4,5 offers more coverage but lacks the temporal resolution needed to distinguish individual spikes reliably and does not measure local field potentials. Until now, no technology compatible with use in unrestrained animals has combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. Here we design, fabricate and test a new silicon probe known as Neuropixels to meet this need. Each probe has 384 recording channels that can programmably address 960 complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) processing-compatible low-impedance TiN6 sites that tile a single 10-mm long, 70 × 20-μm cross-section shank. The 6 × 9-mm probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, multiplexed and digitized on the base, allowing the direct transmission of noise-free digital data from the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were recorded simultaneously from five brain structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels probes allowed large populations of neurons from several brain structures to be recorded in freely moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip fabrication methods opens a path towards recording of brain-wide neural activity during behaviour.},

the tracking-by-detection paradigm. However, they also introduce a major
challenge for learning methods, as defining a model that can operate on such

learning-based work has been devoted to learning better features for MOT, and
then using these with well-established optimization frameworks. In this work,
we exploit the classical network flow formulation of MOT to define a fully
differentiable framework based on Message Passing Networks (MPNs). By operating
directly on the graph domain, our method can reason globally over an entire set
of detections and predict final solutions. Hence, we show that learning in MOT
does not need to be restricted to feature extraction, but it can also be
applied to the data association step. We show a significant improvement in both

   abstract = {Object detection is one of the most important areas in computer vision, which plays a key role in various practical scenarios. Due to limitation of hardware, it is often necessary to sacrifice accuracy to ensure the infer speed of the detector in practice. Therefore, the balance between effectiveness and efficiency of object detector must be considered. The goal of this paper is to implement an object detector with relatively balanced effectiveness and efficiency that can be directly applied in actual application scenarios, rather than propose a novel detection model. Considering that YOLOv3 has been widely used in practice, we develop a new object detector based on YOLOv3. We mainly try to combine various existing tricks that almost not increase the number of model parameters and FLOPs, to achieve the goal of improving the accuracy of detector as much as possible while ensuring that the speed is almost unchanged. Since all experiments in this paper are conducted based on PaddlePaddle, we call it PP-YOLO. By combining multiple tricks, PP-YOLO can achieve a better balance between effectiveness (45.2% mAP) and efficiency (72.9 FPS), surpassing the existing state-of-the-art detectors such as EfficientDet and YOLOv4.Source code is at https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection.},

algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN
have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region
proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region
Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the
detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a
fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and
objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate
high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We
further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their
convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural
networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified
network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has
a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving
state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS
COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015

   abstract = {With recent advances in object detection, the tracking-by-detection method has become mainstream for multi-object tracking in computer vision. The tracking-by-detection scheme necessarily has to resolve a problem of data association between existing tracks and newly received detections at each frame. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network (DNN) architecture that can solve the data association problem with a variable number of both tracks and detections including false positives. The proposed network consists of two parts: encoder and decoder. The encoder is the fully connected network with several layers that take bounding boxes of both detection and track-history as inputs. The outputs of the encoder are sequentially fed into the decoder which is composed of the bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a projection layer. The final output of the proposed network is an association matrix that reflects matching scores between tracks and detections. To train the network, we generate training samples using the annotation of Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). The experiment results show that the proposed network achieves considerably high recall and precision rate as the binary classifier for the assignment tasks. We apply our network to track multiple objects on real-world datasets and evaluate the tracking performance. The performance of our tracker outperforms previous works based on DNN and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods.},

   abstract = {Local $\beta$-actin synthesis in growth cones of developing axons plays an important role in growth cone steering; however, the mRNA binding proteins required for this process are unknown. Here we used Zbp1 / Imp1 −/− mice to test the hypothesis that zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) is required for the regulation of $\beta$-actin mRNA transport and local translation underlying growth cone guidance. To address the biological function of ZBP1, we developed a novel in vitro turning assay with primary cortical neuron balls having axons >1 mm in length and demonstrate that growth cones of mammalian neurons exhibit protein synthesis-dependent attraction to either netrin-1 or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Interestingly, this attraction is lost in Zbp1 -deficient neurons. Furthermore, BDNF-stimulated $\beta$-actin mRNA localization was attenuated in Zbp1 -deficient neurons, which impaired enrichment of $\beta$-actin protein in the growth cone. Finally, using a photoconvertible translation reporter, we found that ZBP1 is necessary for netrin-1 stimulated local translation of $\beta$-actin mRNA in axonal growth cones. Together, these results suggest that netrin-1- and BDNF-induced growth cone attraction required ZBP1-mediated local translation of $\beta$-actin mRNA, and therefore ZBP1 regulates protein synthesis-dependent axon guidance. Thus, mRNA binding proteins regulating local translation can control spatiotemporal protein expression in response to guidance cues and directional cell motility.},

Here, we developed patterned neuronal circuits using micro fabricated devices, comprising a micro-well array bonded to a microelectrode-array substrate. Approach. The micro-well array consisted of micrometre-scale wells connected by tunnels, all contained within a silicone slab called a micro-chamber. The design of the micro-chamber confined somata to the wells and allowed axons to grow through the tunnels bidirectionally but with a designed, unidirectional bias. We guided axons into the point of the arrow structure where one of the two tunnel entrances is located, making that the preferred direction. Main results. When rat cortical neurons were cultured in the wells, their axons grew through the tunnels and connected to neurons in adjoining wells. Unidirectional burst transfers and other asymmetric signal-propagation phenomena were observed via the substrate-embedded electrodes. Seventy-nine percent of burst transfers were in the forward direction. We also observed rapid propagation of activity from sites of local electrical stimulation, and significant effects of inhibitory synapse blockade on bursting activity. Significance. These results suggest that this simple, substrate-controlled neuronal circuit can be applied to develop in vitro models of the function of cortical microcircuits or deep neural networks, better to elucidate the laws governing the dynamics of neuronal networks.},

   abstract = {The architecture of neuron connectivity in brain networks is one of the basic mechanisms by which to organize and sustain a particular function of the brain circuitry. There are areas of the brain composed of well-organized layers of neurons connected by unidirectional synaptic connections (e.g., cortex, hippocampus). Re-engineering of the neural circuits with such a heterogeneous network structure in culture may uncover basic mechanisms of emergent information functions of these circuits. In this study, we present such a model designed with two subpopulations of primary hippocampal neurons (E18) with directed connectivity grown in a microfluidic device with asymmetric channels. We analysed and compared neurite growth in the microchannels with various shapes that promoted growth dominantly in one direction. We found an optimal geometric shape features of the microchannels in which the axons coupled two chambers with the neurons. The axons grew in the promoted direction and formed predefined connections during the first 6 days in vitro (DIV). The microfluidic devices were coupled with microelectrode arrays (MEAs) to confirm unidirectional spiking pattern propagation through the microchannels between two compartments. We found that, during culture development, the defined morphological and functional connectivity formed and was maintained for up to 25 DIV.},

   abstract = {Various experimental models are used to study brain development and degeneration. They range from whole animal models, which preserve anatomical structures but strongly limit investigations at the cellular level, to dissociated cell culture systems that allow detailed observation of cell phenotypes but lack the highly ordered physiological neuron connection architecture. We describe here a platform comprising independent cell culture chambers separated by an array of "axonal diodes". This array involves asymmetric micro-channels, imposing unidirectional axon connectivity with 97% selectivity. It allows the construction of complex, oriented neuronal networks not feasible with earlier platforms. Different neuronal subtypes could be co-cultivated for weeks, and sequential seeding of different cell populations reproduced physiological network development. To illustrate possible applications, we created and characterized a cortico-striatal oriented network. Functional synaptic connections were established. The activation of striatal differentiation by cortical axons, and the synchronization of neural activity were demonstrated. Each neuronal population and subcompartment could be chemically addressed individually. The directionality of neural pathways being a key feature of the nervous system organization, the axon diode concept brings in a paradigmatic change in neuronal culture platforms, with potential applications for studying neuronal development, synaptic transmission and neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases at the sub-cellular, cellular and network levels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.},

   abstract = {Cultured neurons on multi electrode arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study various aspects of neuronal (network) functioning. A possible drawback of this approach is the lack of structure in these networks. At the single cell level, several solutions have been proposed to enable directed connectivity, and promising results were obtained. At the level of connected sub-populations, a few attempts have been made with promising results. First assessment of the designs' functionality, however, suggested room for further improvement. We designed a two chamber MEA aiming to create a unidirectional connection between the networks in both chambers ("emitting" and "receiving"). To achieve this unidirectionality, all interconnecting channels contained barbs that hindered axon growth in the opposite direction (from receiving to emitting chamber). Visual inspection showed that axons predominantly grew through the channels in the promoted direction. This observation was confirmed by spontaneous activity recordings. Cross-correlation between the signals from two electrodes inside the channels suggested signal propagation at ≈2 m/s from emitting to receiving chamber. Cross-correlation between the firing patterns in both chambers indicated that most correlated activity was initiated in the emitting chamber, which was also reflected by a significantly lower fraction of partial bursts (i.e., a one-chamber-only burst) in the emitting chamber. Finally, electrical stimulation in the emitting chamber induced a fast response in that chamber, and a slower response in the receiving chamber. Stimulation in the receiving chamber evoked a fast response in that chamber, but no response in the emitting chamber. These results confirm the predominantly unidirectional nature of the connecting channels from emitting to receiving chamber.},

   abstract = {Transient propagation of information across neuronal assembles is thought to underlie many cognitive processes. However, the nature of the neural code that is embedded within these transmissions remains uncertain. Much of our understanding of how information is transmitted among these assemblies has been derived from computational models. While these models have been instrumental in understanding these processes they often make simplifying assumptions about the biophysical properties of neurons that may influence the nature and properties expressed. To address this issue we created an in vitro analog of a feed-forward network composed of two small populations (also referred to as assemblies or layers) of living dissociated rat cortical neurons. The populations were separated by, and communicated through, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device containing a strip of microscale tunnels. Delayed culturing of one population in the first layer followed by the second a few days later induced the unidirectional growth of axons through the microtunnels resulting in a primarily feed-forward communication between these two small neural populations. In this study we systematically manipulated the number of tunnels that connected each layer and hence, the number of axons providing communication between those populations. We then assess the effect of reducing the number of tunnels has upon the properties of between-layer communication capacity and fidelity of neural transmission among spike trains transmitted across and within layers. We show evidence based on Victor-Purpura’s and van Rossum’s spike train similarity metrics supporting the presence of both rate and temporal information embedded within these transmissions whose fidelity increased during communication both between and within layers when the number of tunnels are increased. We also provide evidence reinforcing the role of synchronized activity upon transmission fidelity during the spontaneous synchronized network burst events that propagated between layers and highlight the potential applications of these MEMs devices as a tool for further investigation of structure and functional dynamics among neural populations.},

   abstract = {We report the design and application of a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMs) device that permits investigators to create arbitrary network topologies. With this device investigators can manipulate the degree of functional connectivity among distinct neural populations by systematically altering their geometric connectivity in vitro. Each polydimethylsilxane (PDMS) device was cast from molds and consisted of two wells each containing a small neural population of dissociated rat cortical neurons. Wells were separated by a series of parallel micrometer scale tunnels that permitted passage of axonal processes but not somata; with the device placed over an 8 × 8 microelectrode array, action potentials from somata in wells and axons in microtunnels can be recorded and stimulated. In our earlier report we showed that a one week delay in plating of neurons from one well to the other led to a filling and blocking of the microtunnels by axons from the older well resulting in strong directionality (older to younger) of both axon action potentials in tunnels and longer duration and more slowly propagating bursts of action potentials between wells. Here we show that changing the number of tunnels, and hence the number of axons, connecting the two wells leads to changes in connectivity and propagation of bursting activity. More specifically, the greater the number of tunnels the stronger the connectivity, the greater the probability of bursting propagating between wells, and shorter peak-to-peak delays between bursts and time to first spike measured in the opposing well. We estimate that a minimum of 100 axons are needed to reliably initiate a burst in the opposing well. This device provides a tool for researchers interested in understanding network dynamics who will profit from having the ability to design both the degree and directionality connectivity among multiple small neural populations.},

A challenge for creating long-term stable interfaces between electronics and neural tissue is the huge mechanical mismatch between the systems. So far, materials and fabrication processes have restricted the development of soft electrode grids able to combine high performance, long-term stability, and high electrode density, aspects all essential for neural interfacing. Here, this challenge is addressed by developing a soft, high-density, stretchable electrode grid based on an inert, high-performance composite material comprising gold-coated titanium dioxide nanowires embedded in a silicone matrix. The developed grid can resolve high spatiotemporal neural signals from the surface of the cortex in freely moving rats with stable neural recording quality and preserved electrode signal coherence during 3 months of implantation. Due to its flexible and stretchable nature, it is possible to minimize the size of the craniotomy required for placement, further reducing the level of invasiveness. The material and device technology presented herein have potential for a wide range of emerging biomedical applications.},

While such systems perform well during acute recordings, they often fail to function reliably in clinically relevant chronic settings. Available evidence suggests that a major failure mode of electrode arrays is the brain tissue reaction against these implants, making the biocompatibility of implanted electrodes a primary concern in device design.

   abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have allowed control of prosthetic limbs in paralyzed patients. Unfortunately, the electrodes of the BCI that interface with the brain only function for a short period of time before the signal quality on these electrodes becomes substantially diminished. To truly realize the potential of BCIs, it is imperative to have electrodes that function chronically. In order to elucidate thephysiological determinants of a chronically functional neural interface, we studied the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in electrode function, because it is a key mediator of neuronal hemostasis. We monitored the status of the BBB and the consequences of BBB breach on electrode function using non-invasive imaging, electrophysiology, genomic, and histological analyses. Rats implanted with commercially available intracortical electrodes demonstrated an inverse correlation between electrode performance and BBB breach over a period of 16 weeks. Genomic analysis showed that chronically functional electrodes elicit an enhanced wound healing response. Conversely, in poorly functioning electrodes, chronic BBB breach led to local accumulation of neurotoxic factors and an influx of pro-inflammatory myeloid cells, which negatively affect neuronal health. These findings were further verified in a subset of electrodes with graded electrophysiological performance. In this study, we determine the mechanistic link between intracortical electrode function and failure. Our results indicate that BBB status is a critical physiological determinant of intracortical electrode function and can inform future electrode design and biochemical intervention strategies to enhance the functional longevity of BCIs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

While devices such as deep brain stimulation electrodes and drug delivery systems have shown clinical success in chronic applications, other devices such as nerve guidance substrates and recording electrodes that operate over a very short length scale have not had the same kind of clinical impact. By reviewing what is currently known about the brain tissue response to implanted electrodes, the authors propose that the foreignbody response, which changes the tissue structure immediately surrounding implanted devices, may be the reason near-function devices are stalled in preclinical development. The article concludes by reviewing recent efforts to reduce the foreign body response, which shows promise to accelerate the clinical development of this new generation of biomedical devices. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: To contribute to the WHO initiative, VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, an assessment of global vision impairment in 2020 and temporal change is needed. We aimed to extensively update estimates of global vision loss burden, presenting estimates for 2020, temporal change over three decades between 1990–2020, and forecasts for 2050. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye disease from January, 1980, to October, 2018. Only studies with samples representative of the population and with clearly defined visual acuity testing protocols were included. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate 2020 prevalence (with 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) of mild vision impairment (presenting visual acuity ≥6/18 and <6/12), moderate and severe vision impairment (<6/18 to 3/60), and blindness (<3/60 or less than 10° visual field around central fixation); and vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia (presenting near vision <N6 or <N8 at 40 cm where best-corrected distance visual acuity is ≥6/12). We forecast estimates of vision loss up to 2050. Findings: In 2020, an estimated 43·3 million (95% UI 37·6–48·4) people were blind, of whom 23·9 million (55%; 20·8–26·8) were estimated to be female. We estimated 295 million (267–325) people to have moderate and severe vision impairment, of whom 163 million (55%; 147–179) were female; 258 million (233–285) to have mild vision impairment, of whom 142 million (55%; 128–157) were female; and 510 million (371–667) to have visual impairment from uncorrected presbyopia, of whom 280 million (55%; 205–365) were female. Globally, between 1990 and 2020, among adults aged 50 years or older, age-standardised prevalence of blindness decreased by 28·5% (–29·4 to −27·7) and prevalence of mild vision impairment decreased slightly (–0·3%, −0·8 to −0·2), whereas prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment increased slightly (2·5%, 1·9 to 3·2; insufficient data were available to calculate this statistic for vision impairment from uncorrected presbyopia). In this period, the number of people who were blind increased by 50·6% (47·8 to 53·4) and the number with moderate and severe vision impairment increased by 91·7% (87·6 to 95·8). By 2050, we predict 61·0 million (52·9 to 69·3) people will be blind, 474 million (428 to 518) will have moderate and severe vision impairment, 360 million (322 to 400) will have mild vision impairment, and 866 million (629 to 1150) will have uncorrected presbyopia. Interpretation: Age-adjusted prevalence of blindness has reduced over the past three decades, yet due to population growth, progress is not keeping pace with needs. We face enormous challenges in avoiding vision impairment as the global population grows and ages.

   abstract = {Neural engineering provides promise for cell therapy by integrating the host brain with brain-machine-interface technologies in order to externally modulate functions. Long-term interfaces with the host brain remain a critical challenge due to insufficient graft cell survivability and loss of brain electrode sensitivity over time. Here, integrated neuron-electrode interfaces are developed on thin flexible and transparent silk films as brain implants. Mechanical properties and surface topography of silk films are optimized to promote cell survival and alignment of primary rat cortical cells. Compartmentalized neural cultures and co-patterned electrode arrays are incorporated on the silk films with built-in wire connections. Electrical stimulation via electrodes embedded in the films activated surrounding neurons to produce evoked calcium responses. In mice brains, silk film implants show conformal contact capable of modulating host brain cells with minimal inflammatory response and stable indwelling for weeks. The approach of combining cell therapy and brain electrodes could provide sustained functional interfaces with ex vivo control with spatial precision. Neuron-electrode interfaces are developed on thin silk films as brain implants. Silk films can use surface topography to induce astrocyte alignment, and microfluidic systems to generate patterned axon tracts. With built-in wire connections in the film, cortical neurons produce robust calcium responses upon electrical stimulation. These brain-compatible implants could potentially provide sustained functional neuron-electrode interfaces for the brain. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

   abstract = {Peripheral nerve lesions lead to nerve degeneration and flaccid paralysis. The first objective in functional rehabilitation of these diseases should be the preservation of the neuro-muscular junction by biological means and following functional electrical stimulation (FES) may restore some function of the paralyzed limb. The combination of biological cells and technical microdevices to biohybrid systems might become a new approach in neural prosthetics research to preserve skeletal muscle function. In this paper, a microdevice for a biohybrid system to interface peripheral nerves after traumatic lesions is presented. The development of the microprobe design and the fabrication technology is described and first experimental results are given and afterwards discussed. The technical microprobe is designed in a way that meets the most important technical requirements: adaptation to the distal nerve stump, suitability to combine the microstructure with a containment for cells, and integrated microelectrodes as information transducers for cell stimulation and monitoring. Micromachining technologies were applied to fabricate a polyimide-based sieve-like microprobe with 19 substrate-integrated ring electrodes and a distributed counter electrode. Monolithic integration of fixation flaps and a three-dimensional shaping technology led to a device that might be adapted to nerve stumps with neurosurgical sutures in the epineurium. First experimental results of the durability of the shaping technology and electrochemical electrode properties were investigated. The three-dimensional shape remained quite stable after sterilization in an autoclave and chronic implantation. Electrode impedance was below 200 kΩ at 1 kHz which ought to permit recording of signals from nerves sprouting through the sieve holes. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Devices containing arrays of electrodes can be used in the study of cells grown in culture or can be implanted into damaged or dysfunctional tissue to restore normal function. While devices are typically designed and used exclusively for one of these two purposes, there have been increasing efforts in developing implantable electrode arrays capable of housing cultured cells, referred to as biohybrid implants. Once implanted, the cells within these implants integrate into the tissue, serving as a mediator of the electrode–tissue interface. This biological component offers unique advantages to these implant designs, providing better tissue integration and potentially long-term stability. Herein, an overview of current research into biohybrid devices, as well as the historical background that led to their development are provided, based on the host anatomical location for which they are designed (CNS, PNS, or special senses).

@article{optogImmunresponse,
   abstract = {Gene delivery to the primate central nervous system via recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) allows neurophysiologists to control and observe neural activity precisely. A current limitation of this approach is variability in vector transduction efficiency. Low levels of transduction can foil experimental manipulations, prompting vector readministration. The ability to make multiple vector injections into the same animal, even in cases where successful vector transduction has already been achieved, is also desirable. However, vector readministration has consequences for humoral immunity and gene delivery that depend on vector dosage and route of administration in complex ways. As part of optogenetic experiments in rhesus monkeys, we analyzed blood sera collected before and after AAV injections into the brain and quantified neutralizing antibodies to AAV using an in vitro assay. We found that injections of AAV1 and AAV9 vectors elevated neutralizing antibody titers consistently. These immune responses were specific to the serotype injected and were long lasting. These results demonstrate that optogenetic manipulations in monkeys trigger immune responses to AAV capsids, suggesting that vector readministration may have a higher likelihood of success by avoiding serotypes injected previously. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-mediated gene delivery is a valuable tool for neurophysiology, but variability in transduction efficiency remains a bottleneck for experimental success. Repeated vector injections can help overcome this limitation but affect humoral immune state and transgene expression in ways that are poorly understood. We show that AAV vector injections into the primate central nervous system trigger long-lasting and serotype-specific immune responses, raising the possibility that switching serotypes may promote successful vector readministration.},

Coexpression of the Drosophila photoreceptor genes encoding arrestin-2, rhodopsin (formed by liganding opsin with retinal), and the α subunit of the cognate heterotrimeric G protein - an explosive combination we term "chARGe" - sensitizes generalist vertebrate neurons to light. Illumination of a mixed population of neurons elicits action potentials selectively and cell-autonomously in its genetically chARGed members. In contrast to bath-applied photostimulants or caged neurotransmitters, which act indiscriminately throughout the illuminated volume, chARGe localizes the responsiveness to light. Distributed activity may thus be fed directly into a circumscribed population of neurons in intact tissue, irrespective of the spatial arrangement of its elements.},

Moreover, retinal prostheses are under development to restore vision by replacing the function of damaged light sensitive photoreceptors, which makes retinal research directly relevant for curing blindness. Here we provide a progress review on stimulation strategies developed in recent years to improve the resolution of electrical stimulation in retinal prostheses. We focus on studies performed with explanted retinas, in which electrophysiological techniques are the most advanced. We summarize achievements in improving the spatial and temporal resolution of electrical stimulation of the retina and methods to selectively stimulate neurons with different visual functions.

These different mechanisms vary in importance depending on the condition being treated and the target being stimulated.

Over the last five decades, progress in neural recording techniques has allowed the number of simultaneously recorded neurons to double approximately every 7 years, mimicking Moore's law. Such exponential growth motivates us to ask how data analysis techniques are affected by progressively larger numbers of recorded neurons. Traditionally, neurons are analyzed independently on the basis of their tuning to stimuli or movement. Although tuning curve approaches are unaffected by growing numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons, newly developed techniques that analyze interactions between neurons become more accurate and more complex as the number of recorded neurons increases. Emerging data analysis techniques should consider both the computational costs and the potential for more accurate models associated with this exponential growth of the number of recorded neurons.},

We have also built a neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted into the brain with micron precision for avoidance of surface vasculature and targeting specific brain regions. The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and digitization: The package for 3072 channels occupies less than 23×18.5×2 mm3. A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the device, recording from all channels simultaneously.

The UIEA records from small populations of neurons which have an average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6:1. We provide specific examples that show the activities of these populations of neurons contain sufficient information to perform control tasks. Results from a simple stimulus detection task using these signals as inputs confirm that the number of neurons presenting a recording is significant in determining task performance. Increasing the number of units in a recording decreases the sensitivity of the response to the stimulus; decreasing the number of units in the recording, however, increases the variability of the response to the stimulus. We conclude that recordings from small populations of neurons, not single units, provide a reliable source of sufficiently stimulus selective signals which should be suitable for a BCI. In addition, the potential for simultaneous and proportional control of a large number of external devices may be realized through the ability of an array of microelectrodes such as the UIEA to record both spatial and temporal patterns of neuronal activation.},

@article{axongrowth3d,
   abstract = {Axons in vivo are guided by molecular signals acting as attractants and repellents, and possibly by physical constraints encountered in the extracellular environment. We analyzed the ability of primary sensory axons to extend and undergo guidance in three-dimensional (3-D) environments generated using photolithography. Confinement of neurons in fully enclosed square chambers decreased the percentage of neurons establishing axons as a function of chamber width. However, the ability to extend an axon in one or more directions allowed axons to form and extend similarly to those on two-dimensional (2-D) substrata. Live imaging of growth cones interacting with the walls of chambers or corridors revealed that growth cones respond to contact with a 3-D constraint by decreasing surface area, and circumvent constraints by repeated sampling of the constraint until an unobstructed path is encountered. Analysis of the ability of axons to turn around corners in corridors revealed that the angle of the corner and corridor width determined the frequency of turning. Finally, we show that the length of axons can be controlled through the use of 3-D constraints. These data demonstrate that 3-D constraints can be used to guide axons, and control the extent of axon formation and the length of axons. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{pdms,
   abstract = {Microfluidic devices have been used to study high-density cultures of many cell types. Because cell-to-cell signaling is local, however, there exists a need to develop culture systems that sustain small numbers of neurons and enable analyses of the microenvironments. Such cultures are hard to maintain in stable form, and it is difficult to prevent cell death when using primary mammalian neurons. We demonstrate that postnatal primary hippocampal neurons from rat can be cultured at low densities within nanoliter-volume microdevices fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Doing so requires an additional fabrication step, serial extractions/washes of PDMS with several solvents, which removes uncrosslinked oligomers, solvent and residues of the platinum catalyst used to cure the polymer. We found this step improves the biocompatibility of the PDMS devices significantly. Whereas neurons survive for ≥ 7 days in open channel microdevices, the ability to culture neurons in closed-channel devices made of untreated, native PDMS is limited to ≤ 2 days. When the closed-channel PDMS devices are extracted, biocompatibility improves allowing for reliable neuron cultures at low densities for ≥ 7 days. Comparisons made to autoclaved PDMS and native, untreated PDMS reveal that the solvent-treated polymer is superior in sustaining low densities of primary neurons in culture. When neuronal affinity for local substrates is observed directly, we find that axons localize to channel corners and prefer PDMS surfaces to glass in hybrid devices. When perfusing the channels with media by gravity flow, cultured hippocampal neurons survive for ≥ 11 days.

It has evolved tremendously,and its applicability and flexibility made its usage grow exponentially and transversely to several research fields. This has been particularly noticeable in neuroscience research,where microfluidic platforms made it possible to address specific questions extending from axonal guidance,synapse formation,or axonal transport to the development of 3D models of the CNS to allow pharmacological testing and drug screening. Furthermore,the continuous upgrade of microfluidic platforms has allowed a deeper study of the communication occurring between different neuronal and glial cells or between neurons and other peripheral tissues,both in physiological and pathological conditions.

   abstract = {The structure and connectivity of cultured neuronal networks can be controlled by using micropatterned surfaces. Here, we demonstrate that the direction of signal propagation can be precisely controlled at a single-cell resolution by growing primary neurons on micropatterns. To achieve this, we first examined the process by which axons develop and how synapses form in micropatterned primary neurons using immunocytochemistry. By aligning asymmetric micropatterns with a marginal gap, it was possible to pattern primary neurons with a directed polarization axis at the single-cell level. We then examined how synapses develop on micropatterned hippocampal neurons. Three types of micropatterns with different numbers of short paths for dendrite growth were compared. A normal development in synapse density was observed when micropatterns with three or more short paths were used. Finally, we performed double patch clamp recordings on micropatterned neurons to confirm that these synapses are indeed functional, and that the neuronal signal is transmitted unidirectionally in the intended orientation. This work provides a practical guideline for patterning single neurons to design functional neuronal networks in vitro with the direction of signal propagation being controlled.},

The platform enables reproducible hydrogel patterning and long-term stable coculture of MNs and SCs over 40 days in vitro based on three distinct design factors. Furthermore, the on-demand detachable substrate allows in-depth biological analysis. We demonstrated the possibility of mimicking segmental demyelination by lysophosphatidylcholine, and recovery of myelin structure by application of two drugs: benzatropine or methylcobalamin.

@article{ctxcircuit,
   abstract = {1. We have studied in vivo the intracellular responses of neurones in cat visual cortex to electrical pulse stimulation of the cortical afferents and have developed a microcircuit that simulates much of the experimental data. 2. Inhibition and excitation are not separable events, because individual neurones are embedded in microcircuits that contribute strong population effects. Synchronous electrical activation of the cortex inevitably set in motion a sequence of excitation and inhibition in every neurone we recorded. The temporal form of this response depends on the cortical layer in which the neurone is located. Superficial layer (layers 2+3) pyramidal neurones show a more marked polysynaptic excitatory phase than the pyramids of the deep layers (layers 5+6). 3. Excitatory effects on pyramidal neurones, particularly the superficial layer pyramids, are in general not due to monosynaptic input from thalamus, but polysynaptic input from cortical pyramids. Since the thalamic input is transient it does not provide the major, sustained excitation arriving at any cortical neurone. Instead the intracortical excitatory connections provide the major component of the excitation. 4. The polysynaptic excitatory response would be sustained well after the stimulus, were it not for the suppressive effect of intracortical inhibition induced by the pulse stimulation. 5. Intracellular recording combined with ionophoresis of gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists and antagonists showed that intracortical inhibition is mediated by GABAA and GABAB receptors. The GABAA component occurs in the early phase of the impulse response. It is reflected in the strong hyperpolarization that follows the excitatory response and lasts about 50 ms. The GABAB component occurs in the late phase of the response, and is reflected in a sustained hyperpolarization that lasts some 200‐300 ms. Both components are seen in all cortical pyramidal neurones. However, the GABAA component appears more powerful in deep layer pyramids than superficial layer pyramids. 6. The microcircuit simulates with good fidelity the above data from experiments in vivo and provides a novel explantation for the apparent lack of significant inhibition during visual stimulation. The basic circuit may be common to all cortical areas studied and thus the microcircuit may be a ‘canonical’ microcircuit for neocortex. © 1991 The Physiological Society},

   abstract = {Neuronal cultures are widely used in neuroscience research. However, the randomness of circuits in conventional cultures prevents accurate in vitro modeling of cortical development and of the pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric disorders. A basic feature of cortical circuits that is not captured in standard cultures of dissociated cortical cells is directional connectivity. In this work, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based device that achieves directional connectivity between micro 3D cultures is demonstrated. The device consists of through-holes for micro three-dimensional (μ3D) clusters of cortical cells connected by microtrenches for axon and dendrite guidance. The design of the trenches relies in part on the concept of axonal edge guidance, as well as on the novel concept of specific dendrite targeting. This replicates dominant excitatory connectivity in the cortex, enables the guidance of the axon after it forms a synapse in passing (an “en passant” synapse), and ensures that directional selectivity is preserved over the lifetime of the culture. The directionality of connections was verified morphologically and functionally. Connections were dependent on glutamatergic synapses. The design of this device has the potential to serve as a building block for the reconstruction of more complex cortical circuits in vitro.},

association problem, which plays a key role in the tracking-by-detection
paradigm of multi-object tracking. The global data association problem was
extensively studied under the minimum-cost flow framework, which is
theoretically attractive as being flexible and globally solvable. However, the
high computational burden has been a long-standing obstacle to its wide
adoption in practice. While enjoying the same theoretical advantages and
maintaining the same optimal solution as the minimum-cost flow framework, our
new framework has a better theoretical complexity bound and leads to orders of
practical efficiency improvement. This new framework is motivated by the
observation that minimum-cost flow only partially models the data association
problem and must be accompanied by an additional and time-consuming searching
scheme to determine the optimal object number. By employing a minimum-cost
circulation framework, we eliminate the searching step and naturally integrate
the number of objects into the optimization problem. By exploring the special
property of the associated graph, that is, an overwhelming majority of the
vertices are with unit capacity, we designed an implementation of the framework
and proved it has the best theoretical complexity so far for the global data
association problem. We evaluated our method with 40 experiments on five MOT
benchmark datasets. Our method was always the most efficient and averagely 53
to 1,192 times faster than the three state-of-the-art methods. When our method
served as a sub-module for global data association methods using higher-order
constraints, similar efficiency improvement was attained. We further
illustrated through several case studies how the improved computational
efficiency enables more sophisticated tracking models and yields better
tracking accuracy.},

of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order

efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling

data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are
discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable
to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.
Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares
favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,

   abstract = {Non-maximum suppression is an integral part of the object detection pipeline.
First, it sorts all detection boxes on the basis of their scores. The detection
box M with the maximum score is selected and all other detection boxes with a
significant overlap (using a pre-defined threshold) with M are suppressed. This
process is recursively applied on the remaining boxes. As per the design of the
algorithm, if an object lies within the predefined overlap threshold, it leads
to a miss. To this end, we propose Soft-NMS, an algorithm which decays the
detection scores of all other objects as a continuous function of their overlap
with M. Hence, no object is eliminated in this process. Soft-NMS obtains
consistent improvements for the coco-style mAP metric on standard datasets like
PASCAL VOC 2007 (1.7% for both R-FCN and Faster-RCNN) and MS-COCO (1.3% for
R-FCN and 1.1% for Faster-RCNN) by just changing the NMS algorithm without any
additional hyper-parameters. Using Deformable-RFCN, Soft-NMS improves
state-of-the-art in object detection from 39.8% to 40.9% with a single model.
Further, the computational complexity of Soft-NMS is the same as traditional
NMS and hence it can be efficiently implemented. Since Soft-NMS does not
require any extra training and is simple to implement, it can be easily
integrated into any object detection pipeline. Code for Soft-NMS is publicly
available on GitHub (http://bit.ly/2nJLNMu).},

@article{BN,
   abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters
of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower
learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

@article{yolo,
   abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object
detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object
detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and
associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes
and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the
whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end
directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes
images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network,
Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving
double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art
detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely
to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very
general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods,
including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images
to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

   abstract = {Theoretical and in vivo neuroscience research suggests that functional information transfer within neuronal networks is influenced by circuit architecture. Due to the dynamic complexities of the brain, it remains a challenge to test the correlation between structure and function of a defined network. Engineering controlled neuronal networks in vitro offers a way to test structural motifs; however, no method has achieved small, multi-node networks with stable, unidirectional connections. Here, we screened ten different microchannel architectures within polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) devices to test their potential for axonal guidance. The most successful design had a 92% probability of achieving strictly unidirectional connections between nodes. Networks built from this design were cultured on multielectrode arrays and recorded on days in vitro 9, 12, 15 and 18 to investigate spontaneous and evoked bursting activity. Transfer entropy between subsequent nodes showed up to 100 times more directional flow of information compared to the control. Additionally, directed networks produced a greater amount of information flow, reinforcing the importance of directional connections in the brain being critical for reliable communication. By controlling the parameters of network formation, we minimized response variability and achieved functional, directional networks. The technique provides us with a tool to probe the spatio-temporal effects of different network motifs.},

   abstract = {Recent advances in bioelectronics and neural engineering allowed the development of brain machine interfaces and neuroprostheses, capable of facilitating or recovering functionality in people with neurological disability. To realize energy-efficient and real-time capable devices, neuromorphic computing systems are envisaged as the core of next-generation systems for brain repair. We demonstrate here a real-time hardware neuromorphic prosthesis to restore bidirectional interactions between two neuronal populations, even when one is damaged or missing. We used in vitro modular cell cultures to mimic the mutual interaction between neuronal assemblies and created a focal lesion to functionally disconnect the two populations. Then, we employed our neuromorphic prosthesis for bidirectional bridging to artificially reconnect two disconnected neuronal modules and for hybrid bidirectional bridging to replace the activity of one module with a real-time hardware neuromorphic Spiking Neural Network. Our neuroprosthetic system opens avenues for the exploitation of neuromorphic-based devices in bioelectrical therapeutics for health care.
